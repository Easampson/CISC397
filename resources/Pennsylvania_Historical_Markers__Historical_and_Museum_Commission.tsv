832	Washington Boro Archaeological Sites	Lancaster	2007	10	20	Roadside	Intersection of Rts. 999 & 441, at community park, Washington Boro	This area contains one of the highest concentrations of archaeological sites in Pennsylvania. The sites range from small camps to large villages and cover 11,000 years of Native American culture. The largest villages were built by the Susquehannocks who controlled the fur trade in the region until 1675 when they were overcome by warfare and disease. Archaeology here has shaped our understanding of Native American lifeways.				Native American	1
